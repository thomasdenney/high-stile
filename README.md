#High Stile

A static site generator written in Go, aiming to be as minimal as possible.

Features:

* Generates a blog
* Creates hard links to avoid excessive copies of static files
* Converts Markdown to HTML using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)
* Pages and posts can be HTML or Markdown

I don't recommend that you use this as I wrote it for my [personal
site](http://www.thomasdenney.co.uk).
